\title{Simulated Methylation Data with B-spline Effects in Dense Scenario}
\format{
A list object.
\describe{
  \item{trait}{A vector of length 1,000 containing disease labels
  (492 cases and 508 controls).}
  \item{methyl}{A 1,000 by 527 matrix containing methylation levels. Each
  row represents the methylaiton profile for one subject. Each
  element of the matrix denotes BS-seq methylation level at a CpG site.}
  \item{pos}{Locations for CpG sites (in base pairs).}

}
\description{
A simulated dataset containing 1,000 subjects and 527 methylation sites.
Methylation effects are smoothed by B-spline basis functions.
20\% of the basis functions are simulated to be causal/associated. Effect
strengths are randomly sampled from U(-0.05, 0.05) distribution.
