\format{A list object.
\describe{
  \item{trait}{A vector of length 1,000 containing disease labels
  (510 cases and 490 controls).}
  \item{methyl}{A 1,000 by 477 matrix containing methylation levels. Each
  row represents the methylaiton profile for one subject. Each
  element of the matrix denotes BS-seq methylation level at a CpG site.}

\description{
A simulated dataset containing 1,000 subjects and 477 methylation sites.
Methylation effects are constructed by first-order autoregressive model.
